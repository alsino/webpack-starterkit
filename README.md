# Slim Webpack Starterkit

A lightweight foundation for your next webpack based frontend project.

Based on [Webkid](http://webkid.io/)â€™s [yet-another-webpack-es6-starterkit](https://github.com/wbkd/yet-another-webpack-es6-starterkit) but extended by Jade

### Installation

```
npm install
```

### Start Dev Server

```
npm run dev
```

### Build Prod Version

```
npm run build
```

### Features:

* ES6 Support via [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)
* SASS Support via [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader)
* Linting via [eslint-loader](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader)
* Hot Module Replacement

### New Features:

* [Normalize.CSS](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [PureCSS](http://purecss.io/) integrated
* Jade Support via [jade-loader](https://github.com/webpack/jade-loader) (no HMR yet)

When you run `npm run build` we use the [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin) to move the css to a separate file and included in the head of your `index.html`, so that the styles are applied before any javascript gets loaded. We disabled this function for the dev version, because the loader doesn't support hot module replacement.
